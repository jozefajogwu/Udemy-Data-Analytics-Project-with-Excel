# Udemy-Data-Analytics-Project-with-Excel

<b>Udemy Project Description</b> <p>
Udemy has a number of courses in the subject areas of Business Finance, Graphic Design, Musical Instruments and Web Development. Each course could be at a particular level – All, Beginner, Intermediate, Expert. The courses are rated by the subscribers between 0 to 1. These courses could be either free or paid. The Udemy course dataset contains all these details in addition to the course title, URL, price, number of subscribers, number of reviews, number of lectures, content duration, and published date. The problem statement is to understand the revenue generated from the courses and find courses whose cost could be increased to generate more revenue for Udemy. The performance of the courses is also analyzed as part of this.
  
 <b> The Problem</b>
  <p>
The business problem is to increase the revenue of the company in the next Quarter by increasing the price of the courses that are most popular. The timeline for the project to be completed is 3 weeks. The data required for the problem are the Udemy courses and its details. The data can be presented in pictorial representation that is comprehensible.
Design
The dataset of the Udemy courses contains a number of courses and its associated details listed as rows. As part of data preparation, data cleaning needs to be done. Data cleaning is the handling of missing and redundant data. The data needs to be cleaned for the analysis to be accurate. Missing data could be handled in multiple ways – deletion or imputation. In deletion all rows containing any columns with null values are removed. In the imputation method, the missing values could be replaced by either the mean, median or mode of the column. This depends on the dataset. In this case, the missing data rows were removed. The duplicate rows were also eliminated.
  Google spreadsheets and Tableau has been used for the data preparation and data visualization. Google Spreadsheets allowed to edit, explore, and visualize the data. The pivot tables in a spreadsheet refreshes itself when the data changes. There are a wide variety of visualizations provided by Spreadsheets that could be used to visualize the data. Along with Spreadsheets, Tableau has also been used. The data was loaded into Tableau, cleaned, and visualized. Tableau allows to create interactive dashboards and can handle large amounts of data.
